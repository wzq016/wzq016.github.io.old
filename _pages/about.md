Hi, nice to e-meet you! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign supervised by [Prof. Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). Previously I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2021 under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). I also have a wonderful period at Google as an intern in 2022. I have a broad interest in natural language processing, especially large language models.
